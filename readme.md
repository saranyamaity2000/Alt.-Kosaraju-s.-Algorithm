I basically tried to apply the basic knowledge of recursion and traversing 
over the problem .

Observation : if [ A B C D E F ] is there and if [A B C D] is strongly 
connected it means if lets say [ A B C ] forming any chain or being strongly
connected then for D to be a part of THAT group D must have an IN-OUT
way from atleast one of (A , B , C)

if the explanation is bit uneasy please refer the code !

The Solution is presented by me only but I am not pretending to be the first
one to use this approach

After Solving KOSARAJU'S problem in GFG , i just happened to check the
solution and found the editorial to be tougher than mine.

Thats why I am sharing my solution if bychance somebody is looking for an 
easy solution 

Have A Nice Day ! ðŸ˜‡
